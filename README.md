# React Cards UI

Creates a basic card layout with image, title, description, price, and button. Built with React, CSS, and SASS.

In the `src/` directory, create an `images/` directory for your images.

Replace the dynamic values for image source, title, description, and price with your own data. Copy and paste more cards if needed.

## Run the App

To run the app in development mode, in the project directory run:

```
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser to view the application.

The page will reload if you make edits.

## Build the App

To build the app for production into a `build/` directory, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will bundle React in production mode and optimize the build for best performance.

The application is ready to be deployed.
